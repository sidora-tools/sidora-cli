# sidora.cli

A CLI for terminal based data extraction and summary for the MPI-SHH Department of Archaeogenetics PANDORA Database

## Quickstart

1. Download the `sidora.R` script
2. Make it executable with `chmod +x sidora.R`
2. Run it with `./sidora.R --help`

This will only work within the MPI-SHH network. It also requires R and most likely a UNIX system.
